This app for now is in development phase and is only focusing on the concept of selling products at stores. This app will provide the expensive softwares used at cash points in supermarts at low cost for stores and small scale busniesses. The idea is to implement all the ERP features but for the project submission we are focusing on cash points only.</p>
